# Project Overview

This project demonstrates a step-by-step walkthrough of Traffic Sign Recognition using Python.

We simulate a CNN workflow to explain the following steps:
- Data exploration
- Preprocessing
- Model training
- Evaluation

The goal is to make the technical approach understandable for both technical and non-technical audiences.
